        <h2>How To Make Honey Sriracha Ground Turkey with Broccoli</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1/2 Tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add in your broccoli and leave untouched for 1-2 minutes to begin browning on one side. Stir and continue cooking until the broccoli is a dark green, around 3-4 minutes longer. Move broccoli to a place and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add your remaining olive oil to the skillet and brown both sides of the ground chicken before mincing and fully cooking.</li>
            <li>While the chicken is cooking, mix the remaining sauce ingredients together. Add the sauce to the fully cooked chicken and cook until thick. Make sure to not burn during this step.</li>
            <li>Once the sauce is thick, add the broccoli back to the skillet and stir everything together. Garnish with sesame seeds and green onions before serving.</li>
        </ol>
