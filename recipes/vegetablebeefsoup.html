            <h2>Ingredients You Will Need</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Ground Beef</b> (ground turkey as alternative) - I personally use ground turkey for this recipe and my family loves it, if opting for ground beef then I would recommend 93/7 lean ground beef.</li>
                    <li><b>Onion</b> - Use a yellow or white onion for this recipe.</li>
                    <li><b>Garlic</b> - I recommend using fresh garlic cloves for this recipe, but one can also use chopped garlic from a jar, or garlic paste from a tube in this recipe.</li>
                    <li><b>Salt and Pepper</b></li>
                    <li><b>Chopped Gold Potatoes</b> - Peel the potatoes and chop into really small cube sized pieces.</li>
                    <li><b>Beef Broth</b> - For the heart healthy folks such as myself, the low sodium is the best option to use in this recipe. For that extra flavor opt for the full-salt beef broth.</li>
                    <li><b>Condensed Tomato Soup</b></li>
                    <li><b>Petite Diced Tomatoes</b></li>
                    <li><b>Green Beans</b> - Fresh is the way to go in my option, for simplicity sake opt for the frozen green</li>
                    <li><b>Mixed Vegetables</b> - I personally opt for the fresh vegetables in this recipe and use green beans, corn, peas, celery, carrots and squash. If you want this to be a quick dinner options, you can opt for a bag of the frozen vegetables instead. Look for an array of at least carrots, peas, corn, and green beans.</li>
                    <li><b>Fresh or Dried Parsley</b></li>
                    <li><b>Fresh or Dried Basil</b></li>
                </ul>
