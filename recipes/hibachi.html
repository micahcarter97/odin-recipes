    <h2>How To Make Hibachi Chicken Steak and Shrimp</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To start this recipe, you are going to want to preheat three of the Blackstone burners over medium high heat (approximately 400 degrees F).</li>
        <li>Drizzle the vegetable oil and sesame oil onto all three of the burners on the Blackstone. Then place the chicken and the steak on the Blackstone, season with salt and pepper. Cook for approximately 4-5 minutes per side until the chicken and steak is cooked to your preferences.</li>
        <li>Add the shrimp to the last Blackstone burner and saute it for 1-2 minutes until pink and longer opaque. Toss the chicken, steak and shrimp together.</li>
        <li>Toss all three into a bowl with the minced garlic, soy sauce, hoison sauce and butter. Coat the chicken, steak and shrimp in the mixture and cook for approximately 1 more minute.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken, steak and shrimp from the Blackstone grill. Allow it to sit for 10 minutes and the it's ready to serve up and enjoy!</li>
        <li>I know you may be hardpressed to simply go in and enjoy your new creation, but I would highly suggest cleaning your Blackstone while it is hot. Trust me as you will be cursing any and everything later if not. To do so I suggest keeping your burners on, applying water to your Blackstone and start scrapping away any excess food into your catch at the back of your blackstone. After, applying a coat of oil to the entire surface for next use will prolong the lifespan of your griddle nearly indefinitely.</li>
