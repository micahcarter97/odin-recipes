# odin-recipes

My first Odin Project, showing off all of what I've learned up until now by creating a website for recipes. At this point, I am getting more comfortable navigating through terminal and finding, editing and changing files. Mix this with the little bit I have completed with freecodecamp, I think I'm going to be able to show off my mediocre skills at HTML at the least.
