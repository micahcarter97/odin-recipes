# odin-recipes

My first Odin Project, showing off all of what I've learned to this point by creating a website for recipes. At this point, I am getting more comfortable navigating through terminal and finding, editing and changing files. Mix this with the little bit I have completed with freecodecamp, I think I'm going to be good to show off my mediocre skills at HTML.
